# Bloggers' Suggestions

## [Some thought on doing the OSCP](https://xapax.github.io/blog/)
* [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org)
    - HTML5 and other basics
    - Advanced things too I'd like to play with later
* Documentation Strategy
    - One directory per box
        - enumeration
        - privesc
        - loot
    - Took notes in Markdown, then converted to PDF in browser
* Gitbook 
    - it was eventually moved from Gitbook to GitHub
* Templates
    - templates for Linux and Windows with outline of steps
* Scripts
    - [Offensive Security's PWB and OSCP - My
      Experience](http://securitysift.com/offsec-pwb-oscp)
    - Write your own adaptation
* Use Oh-my-zsh
    - looks pretty, what's the utility?
* Start doing VMs from VulnHub
    - Do 15-20 VMs, do write-ups
    - Then move on to Windows, e.g. Metasploitable 3
* Other resources
    - Georgia Weidman's book - do the exercises
    - Metasploit Unleashed
